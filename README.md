Travel Planner App
Overview
The Travel Planner App is a project built from scratch to consolidate the skills I've learned in web development, focusing on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and integrating multiple APIs in a dynamic web application. This app allows users to plan their trips by entering their travel destination and departure date, providing current or future weather forecasts and a relevant image of the location.

Features
Form Input: Users can enter a destination city and a departure date.
Weather Forecast: Depending on the departure date, the app displays current or predicted weather using the Weatherbit API.
Location Coordinates: Uses the Geonames API to convert city names to geographical coordinates required by the Weatherbit API.
Location Images: Fetches an image of the destination city using the Pixabay API.
Countdown Timer: Displays the number of days left until the trip.
Responsive Design: Clean and modern user interface built with HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: Core logic of the app, including API requests, data processing, and DOM manipulation.
HTML/CSS (SCSS): Structure and styling of the app.
Webpack: Module bundler for compiling the appâ€™s assets and managing dependencies.
Express Server: Provides a backend environment for serving the app.
Service Workers: Caching and offline functionality.
APIs Used:
Geonames API: Retrieves geographic coordinates based on city names.
Weatherbit API: Provides weather data for the specified coordinates.
Pixabay API: Fetches images based on the entered location.
